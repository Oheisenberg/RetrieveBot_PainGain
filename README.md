# RetrieveBot_PainGain
#This repository contains my first built project, with the help of Codecademy, to build a closed-domain retrieve bot that specialises in giving people advice on certain exercises and their diet.

#I chose a retrieve bot as it was less taxing on my computer. In addition, I consider myself a novice I wanted to practice with something closer to my knowledge rather than an AI chatbot.

#From Spacy I used "en_core_web_sm" which is a small model for word vectors, so possibly in the future I create my own model word vectors.

#Techniques that are the most important are: creating a function to preprocess your sentences using tokenization and getting the part of speech tag to extract the important noun in the sentence so the retrieve bot can understand the intent.

#The difficult part of this project was to find a model from spacy that I could import and the lambda tool.

#I plan to expand the responses so that their is more to talk about with the bot, which will take a lot of time if people and I have a lot of ideas. I know I put format for the entities, however they were always providing the wrong fill-in word so I removed them. I might put them back as I improve this chatbot.
